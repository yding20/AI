1. The fist part is done. The code works well for provided three.xml files. The only problem is that the recursive call must be executed in Topological Order. So it is better to read the file in topological order. The first two files are fine, the third one I modified the code a little bit, which might not work for other input files. Since I wrote the read input by myself. It might not work for other formats.
