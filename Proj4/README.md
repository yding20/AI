The file shows how to bulid the project and output of the project. The detailed analysis and demenstation to meet the requirement is explained in the .pdf write up report. 

1. For DecisionTree
	cd DecisionTree
	javac DecisionTreeLearner.java
	java DecisionTreeLearner

	the sample out put is :
	The accuracy on iris.data_test :  	0.8055555555555556
	The accuracy on car.data_test : 	0.8470209339774557

2. For Neural Network (python3, please use import Pandas and TensorFlow)
	cd ..
	cd TensorFlow 
	python NeuralNets_1.py

	The parameter is set to run in reasonable time not optimal for results, just for illustation purpose
	sample output : (take about 9s)
	Cost after epoch 0: 1.075947
	Cost after epoch 1000: 0.560075
	Cost after epoch 2000: 0.311763
	Cost after epoch 3000: 0.217161
	Cost after epoch 4000: 0.176332
	Cost after epoch 5000: 0.161841
	Cost after epoch 6000: 0.155853

	Cost after epoch 8000: 0.151888
	Cost after epoch 9000: 0.151257
	Train Accuracy: 0.93333334
	Test Accuracy: 0.8148148



	python  NeuralNets_2.py
